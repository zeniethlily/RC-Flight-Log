# SEI-23 Project #2: RC-Flight-Log

## Problem

As a hobbyist in the field of Radio-Controlled Airplanes, I often lose track of when to service the aircraft - most often just the engine. Forgetting to maintain them leads to increased wear in the parts and failures in flight, which more than often ends in a crash.

### The Solution!

The app is designed so that I can log flights as soon as they are completed, or at the end of each flying day. The total flight time for each airplane is checked against the service interval to determine if the airplane is in need of maintenance. Simple! and no more mid-flight engine failures!

## Tech used

To implement this app, I used :
* HTML, EJS, Bootstrap to build and style the pages.
* JavaScript/JQuery to handle DOM and tally the total flight times. 
* mongoDB/mongoose to store data entered by the user 
* Node.js / Express to handle the data being sent to the database and user.

## Unsolved problems / extra planned features

No real issues with the app currently, was planning to add QR codes to allow instant logging of the flight since all registered aircraft have a QR tag on them. Will implement this some time in the future.
